# Elden Ring App

This is something I'm working on in my free time and is very much incomplete at the moment.


## Goals

- Recreate Elden Ring's UI 
- Accurately model Elden Ring game data (character attributes, weapon/equipment stats, damage, status effects, etc.)
- Function as a build planner
- Function as a weapon AR calculator
- Provide item collection & quest+ completion checklists
- Provide helpful cheatsheets for common game metrics/stats
